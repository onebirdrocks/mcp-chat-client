- High contrast alternatives available

## Accessibility Configuration

### User Preferences

Users can customize accessibility settings through the Settings â†’ Accessibility panel:

#### Visual Accessibility
- **High Contrast Mode**: Increases color contrast for better visibility
- **Large Text**: Increases text size throughout the interface
- **Enhanced Focus Indicators**: Shows clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation

#### Motion and Animation
- **Reduced Motion**: Minimizes animations and transitions

#### Interaction
- **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation**: Improves keyboard navigation with arrow keys and shortcuts
- **Screen Reader Announcements**: Announces important changes and updates to screen readers

### System Integration

The application automatically detects and respects system accessibility preferences:
- System high contrast settings
- System reduced motion preferences
- System font size preferences
- Browser accessibility settings

## Testing and Compliance

### Automated Testing
- Jest-axe integration for automated accessibility testing
- Continuous integration accessibility checks
- Component-level accessibility testing
- WCAG compliance validation

### Manual Testing
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- High contrast mode testing
- Mobile accessibility testing

### Compliance Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Section 508 compliance
- EN 301 549 compliance
- Platform-specific accessibility guidelines (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)
