# MCP Chat UI Requirements Document

## Project Overview

MCP Chat UI is a modern web chat application that provides users with a secure interface for interacting with frontier large language models (OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) while seamlessly integrating with local MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The system adopts a local-first architecture to ensure data privacy and complete user control over AI tool execution.

The application follows a three-tier architecture design:
- **Frontend Layer**: Modern user interface built with React + Vite
- **Backend Layer**: Next.js API routes handling session management and LLM communication
- **Tool Layer**: Local MCP servers providing tool execution capabilities

Core features include secure API key management, real-time chat experience, tool execution confirmation mechanisms, multi-language support, and comprehensive data privacy protection.

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Chat Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have conversations with AI models through a web chat interface, so that I can interact naturally with large language models in a familiar chat format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the chat application THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with message history and input field
2. WHEN I type a message and click send THEN the system SHALL immediately display my message and show a loading indicator
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL display formatted response content in the chat history
4. WHEN I scroll through chat history THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and auto-scroll to new messages
5. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL preserve my chat session and message history
6. WHEN messages contain code or Markdown content THEN the system SHALL correctly render formatted content

### Requirement 2: LLM Provider Configuration and Security Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my LLM provider and API credentials, so that I can use my preferred AI service with my own API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure OpenAI, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter providers
2. WHEN I enter API credentials THEN the system SHALL securely store them in the backend with AES encryption and never expose them to the frontend
3. WHEN I test my API configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the connection using backend-stored credentials and display success/error status
4. WHEN I create a new chat THEN the system SHALL allow me to select the LLM provider and specific model that supports tool calling
5. IF my API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent chat attempts
6. WHEN I view my API key settings THEN the system SHALL display only masked versions (showing last 4 characters) for security
7. WHEN I update API configuration THEN the system SHALL provide connection testing functionality to validate new configuration validity

### Requirement 3: MCP Server Integration and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to my local MCP servers, so that AI models can access and use tools I have installed locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure MCP server settings THEN the system SHALL support JSON configuration format for server definitions
2. WHEN I specify MCP servers THEN the system SHALL allow me to define server commands, arguments, and environment variables
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically connect to configured MCP servers using StdioClientTransport
4. WHEN MCP servers are connected THEN the system SHALL list available tools and their schema definitions
5. WHEN an MCP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display connection status and retry options
6. WHEN I update MCP configuration THEN the system SHALL reconnect to servers without requiring app restart
7. WHEN server connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and troubleshooting suggestions

### Requirement 4: Tool Execution Control and Confirmation Mechanism

**User Story:** As a user, I want explicit control over tool execution, so that I can review and approve any actions before they are performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI model requests to use a tool THEN the system SHALL pause execution and display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN I see a tool confirmation THEN it SHALL clearly show the tool name, description, and parameters
3. WHEN I click "Run" THEN the system SHALL execute the tool and continue the conversation displaying results
4. WHEN I click "Cancel" THEN the system SHALL abort the tool call and inform the AI that the action was cancelled
5. WHEN a tool executes THEN the system SHALL display both the tool output and the AI's interpretation of results
6. WHEN a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL display error information and allow the AI to respond appropriately
7. WHEN multiple tools are requested THEN the system SHALL handle them sequentially with individual confirmations for each tool

### Requirement 5: Seamless Tool Integration Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to handle tool calls gracefully, so that conversations flow naturally even when tools are involved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is pending confirmation THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the conversation is paused
2. WHEN a tool executes successfully THEN the system SHALL show the tool result and continue the conversation seamlessly
3. WHEN a tool fails THEN the system SHALL display the error and allow the AI to respond appropriately
4. WHEN multiple tools are requested THEN the system SHALL handle them sequentially with individual confirmations for each tool
5. WHEN I have a long conversation with tools THEN the system SHALL maintain context and conversation flow
6. WHEN tool execution takes a long time THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status updates

### Requirement 6: Modern Technology Stack and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be built with modern web technologies, so that it's maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL use React with TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN building the backend THEN the system SHALL use Next.js API routes for server functionality
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use Zustand for predictable state management
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for consistent design
5. WHEN handling MCP communication THEN the system SHALL use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for protocol compliance
6. WHEN implementing internationalization THEN the system SHALL use react-i18next for multi-language support
7. WHEN building and developing THEN the system SHALL use Vite for fast development experience

### Requirement 7: Data Privacy and Security Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to remain private and secure, so that my conversations and API keys are not exposed to external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN all processing SHALL occur locally without sending data to external servers except for LLM API calls
2. WHEN I store API keys THEN they SHALL be encrypted and stored securely in the backend with AES encryption
3. WHEN MCP tools execute THEN they SHALL run on my local machine with my permissions
4. WHEN I close the application THEN sensitive data SHALL be cleared from memory appropriately
5. WHEN I export chat history THEN it SHALL be saved locally without cloud synchronization and exclude sensitive data like API keys
