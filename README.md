# mcp-chat-client
A **web-based chat client** for interacting with **frontier LLMs** (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) and **local MCP servers**.  
This project demonstrates how to build a **React + TypeScript** frontend that integrates with an MCP server (such as [`ebook-mcp`](https://github.com/yourusername/ebook-mcp)) to enable **tool execution with user confirmation**, **real-time messaging**, and **multi-LLM provider support**.
